        <p>It's great that you want to find out more about me and I truly appreaciated it. I'll start with the obvious which is my name is John Pepp and born in Livonia, MI. The picture is of yours truly that was recently taken with my new iPhone XR and in my opinion smartphones can take fantastic pictures in their own right. Favorite hobby is building LEGO Creative Expert sets and I run a Facebook Group page called A Fan of LEGO (AFOL). Love working with Computers and consider myself a tech geek. Been using computers since the early 1980s and even used to run a Bulletin Board Serivce (BBS) in the late 1980s and 1990s, this was before the Internet became popular. Around 2000 started to building my own Personal Computers and even obtained certification as a PC Technician from Schoolcraft College. My building phase of building Windows based computers lasted until 2009-2010 then I decided to switched over to Apple and the iMac computer.</p>

        <p>I earned an Associate Degree in Computer Graphics Technology in December 2010 from Schoolcraft College which is located in Livonia, Michigan. I continued taking college courses in Motion Graphics and Web Design after obtaining my degree. Self-taught myself PHP in order to learn a backend language in order create content management systems and other useful web applications. I am seriously getting into photography and videography with hopes of incorporating my LEGO hobby into it. I plan on starting my own podcast to cover a wide range of topics, but most of the topics will be based on technology, photography and videography. In conclusion I would like to dedicate this website and future endeavors to my mother, Mildred I. Pepp who past away on February 26, 2017.</p>
