        <h1>Worth a Thousand Words</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>That's the old saying about photography and it still holds true into today's digital world. Photography can express emotions that would be hard to put into words. It does not matter if you have a Smartphone, Mirrorless or DSLR camera, the objective is to capture that moment in time. The Miniature Photographer website is going to deal with my best pictures and it will in time feature my best videos. I plan on having an upload section where people can upload their pictures and have them critique by other photographers if they so desire to do so.</p>
