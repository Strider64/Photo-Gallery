            <p>Wildlife, Portrait, and Macro will be the main focus of Pepster's Place along with explanations on how I obtained the picture and the what camera gear I used. I'm starting a photography podcast that will explore my photography in depth and give my review of the camera gear that I use. Reviews will be what I like and don't like of my current camera gear, it won't be to technical in nature. There are plenty of YouTube Videos out there that go in to great detail on camera gear, but that isn't the intention of this website. I will also never bash another camera brand, for a camera is only as good as the person behind the view finder and practically all of the major camera manufacturers make good cameras. I will also discuss camera accessories such as tripods, sliders and other accessories that help me in my photography process. The one thing I have learned so far is that photography on a professional level is expensive and hopefully in the long run it will be worth it</p>

            <p>The Sony A7R III camera is going to be the workhorse for this website the will include both photography and videos. This is my very first professional camera that I have ever owned. I could have gone the tradional DSLR camera route (Nikon D850 for example), but I'm technology gear head that making the decision of buying a full frame mirrorless camera a no brainer. The camera lenses I use for the Sony A7R II camera are the Sony FE 100-400mm F4.5â€“5.6 GM OSS (a telephoto lens), a Sony 24-70mm f/4 Vario-Tessar T FE OSS, Sony FE 85mm f/1.8 Lens, Sony FE 90mm f/2.8 Macro G OSS Lens, and a Zeiss Batis Lens 2/25.</p>
